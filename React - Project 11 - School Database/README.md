Add Grades: Users can add grades from exams to every student belonging to a selected class. This functionality simplifies the process of recording and managing student grades, making it convenient for teachers or administrators.

View Student Grades: Users have the option to view the grades of specific students. By selecting a student, the app presents their grades, providing a comprehensive overview of their academic performance.
